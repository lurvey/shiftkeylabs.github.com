## Skills Workshop #1: Typography and Calligraphy Seminar and Workshop with Kevin King @ Halfiax Public Library

* Attended seminar with Canadian Typographer Kevin King.
* Learned how the written language begin and how it developed into what we see today.
* Kevin taught about the importance of calligraphy and typography and how it relates to design.
* The following morning got together with Kevin a smaller setting for more lessons on typography and saw his own work, and learned how he got to where he is today.
* Learning how letterforms are drawn by the hand really shows how typefaces are designed.
