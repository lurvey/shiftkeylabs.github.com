+ +## Skills Workshop #1: Association of Registered Graphic Designers Annual General Meeting and Speed-Mentoring
+ +
+ +* The event began with the annual general meeting. I found it valuable to see the inner-workings of this organization.
+ +* Learned about the Association of Registered Graphic Designers and what they have to offer.
+ +* While this event was similar to the other portfolio review night I went to, it was equally, if not, more valuable.
+ +* With the feedback from the previous portfolio night, I had made changes to my portfolio.
+ +* Much of the feedback I got was generally positive, but the most impactful meeting I had was with the creative director of a studio in town
+ +* He was the most critical of everyone I talked to, but had the most interesting feed back out of anyone.
+ +* His views were quite different than others I've talked to. If anything it taught me to know who I am applying to in the future, and tailor my work for that person.
+ +* Getting my portfolio ready and learning how to present my work is one of the most important skills that I could be learning right now.
